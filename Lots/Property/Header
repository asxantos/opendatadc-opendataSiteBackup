<h5 class="text-left">Property or parcel data is a critical layer to any city or statewide data holdings. In our city's complex urban environment, this includes numerous geographies that identify federal government lands, reservations, District lands, personal property and so much more. The District's Vector Property Mapping (VPM) project works daily to capture property lot transactions so that city planners, business development leaders and residents stay current.
