<!--These three sections appear in one row beneath the Condo Lots in Detail introduction. They should be in three separate text boxes.-->

<!--Box one-->
<h3 class="text-left">Approved for Ground</h3>
<h6 class="text-left">When condos are approved for <i>ground lots</i> (aka, record lots), those remain in the <a href="http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/condo-approval-lots">condo approval layer</a>. Its attributions are also updated to reflect them. The following fields are populated once condo lots have been approved:
<br>
<br>
<li>CONDO_BOOK_NUM</li>
<li>CONDO_PAGE_NUM</li>
<li>CONDO_REGIME_NUM</li>
<li>CONDOLOT</li>
</h6>

<!--Box two-->
<h3 class="text-left">Approved for Overlay</h3>
<h6 class="text-left">When condos are approved for <i>overlay lots</i> (aka, air rights and tax lots), those now become dead lots and archived to their respective history layer. Search for these by performing a query where the value in the <i>UNDERLIES_CONDO</i> field is equal to 1.

<!--Box three-->
<h3 class="text-left">Condo Relationships</h3>
<h6>These tables are related based on the <i>REGIME</i> value and will help to quantify the number of condos residing on a lot - grouping of condos. The regime number starts with a 1, 2, or 3 depending upon where the condo is located and where they fall in the tax assessment process. All numbers after the first are consecutive. Use <i>REGIME</i> as a primary key between these tables.
