<h6>The District's <a target="_blank" href="https://octo.dc.gov">Chief Technology Office (OCTO)</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://otr.cfo.dc.gov/">Office of Tax and Revenue (OTR)</a> Real Property Tax Administration (RPTA), and <a target="_blank" href="https://dcra.dc.gov">Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affair's (DCRA)</a> Surveyor's Office (OS) manage the vector property map data. OCTO's primary responsibility is data distribution, project support and mapping of Federal lands, while RPTA & OS are responsible for data maintenance and property transactions. There are two methods for creating new property boundaries. First, via the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affair's (DCRA) Surveyor's Office where they will generate a Subdivision upon request. Second, from OTR's Real Property Mapping and Assessment Division where they will generate Assessment & Taxation Plats.  The District maintains a history of lots as real estate transactions occur, such as sales or development.</h6>
