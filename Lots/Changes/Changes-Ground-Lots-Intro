<h3 class="text-left">Ground Surface Lots</h3>
<h6>These <a href="http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/record-lots">records</a> and <a href="http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/reservation-boundaries">reservations</a> are considered ground lots and can only be combined, subdivided, or killed by itself. It is why in most scenarios you can only obtain a building permit for record lots. Reservations were acquired by the Federal government by purchase, condemnation, dedication or as a gift. Almost all U.S. reservations are under the Jurisdiction of the National Park Service. Note that both may have superseding <a href="http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/tax-lots">tax lots</a> for land tracking purposes.</h6>

<!--Include the Of-Lot process directly beneath the two items above.-->

<h6>
The <i>"of-lot"</i> Process:
<br>
<br>
A ground lot can also become an <i>of-lot</i> if and when there is an overlay that is being subdivided for development or sale. An <i>of-lot</i> is the D.C. Surveyorâ€™s Office term for describing <i>Remaining Part of Original Lot.</i> Sometimes this is done to obtain permitting.
<br>
<br>
If a value of 1 is in the <i>OF_LOT_SEQ</i> field, you can assume that at one time the original lot was modified. Typically, any of these <i>of-lots</i> will also have a tax lot overlapping them since it is a piece or remainder of a record lot. There are approximately 11,500 <i>of-lots</i>.
