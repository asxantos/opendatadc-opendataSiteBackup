<h3 class="text-left">Is VPM data considered a legal field survey?</h3>
Short answer, NO. This is very important.
<br>
<br>
These are representations of property boundaries but should not be used for property line disputes. A licensed land surveyor is the only legal means of determining property boundaries. The VPM data in most cases will never be as accurate as a legal survey; it is difficult to maintain a dataset at that accuracy when you have over 180,000 properties city-wide and only about 7% have been field surveyed.
<br>
<br>
Furthermore, cadastral maps provide an approximation of property location for taxing purposes. A land survey provides a legal document that is admissible in court.
