<p class="text-left">Released a significant update to the Districtâ€™s Open Data Catalog. The catalog now features recently published web applications built by the OCTO Data Team that directly link to the data. It also takes visitors to a wealth of educational content for using web services, APIs, and even an application starter kit for developers on GitHub.  The Data Team also maintained and documented hundreds of datasets for opendata.dc.gov. Many new or extensively upgraded datasets were released in the past year.
