<h1 class="text-center">Enterprise Dataset Inventory (EDI)</h1>
<p class="text-center">The District government has completed its first <a href="http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/enterprise-dataset-inventory">data inventory,</a> published on March 11, 2018. Over the course of this year's inventory, 79 agencies recorded 1,640 enterprise datasets. This is nearly 80% of the 99 agencies that were asked to participate. All 69 mayoral agencies, required to participate, worked with the <a href="https://octo.dc.gov">Office of the Chief Technology Officer</a> to identify and record their enterprise datasets. In contrast, only 10 of the city’s 30 independent agencies participated. Unlike mayoral agencies, independent agencies were not required to participate. The inventory is a great beginning to what will be continued work. This includes both publishing Level 0 data and improving the inventory process for future recording of “open by default” datasets. Here is what we are seeing from the data. Find our analysis methods in DC's <a href="https://github.com/DCgov/enterprise-dataset-inventory">Enterprise Dataset Inventory GitHub</a> repo.</p>
