<h4>Adopt Reasonable and Uniform Retention Policy for Email</h4>
<br>
<p>Currently the District of Columbia does not have a retention schedule for email. Absent a policy, OCTO stores all email for all agencies indefinitely. Currently, OCTO stores more than 293 terabytes of email and attached documents. The oldest email in OCTOâ€™s collection is from 1998. This results in two problems:
<br>
<br>
<li>Email storage must be spread among multiple servers, and searching for old emails is cumbersome. When District agencies fail to meet legislated requirements for processing FOIA requests, slow email searches often constitute a large portion of the delay.</li>
<li>Storing that much email is expensive, and costs continue to mount.</li>
<br>
Therefore, the Mayor should adopt a reasonable email retention policy that requires email be stored for a fixed period of time. Ideally, the Mayor can also adopt a uniform standard that applies to all agencies and types of email content. A uniform standard can be cost effectively administered.
