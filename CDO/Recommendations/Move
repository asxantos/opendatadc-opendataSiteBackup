<h4>Move EDI and CDO Report Deadline to the Monday of Sunshine Week</h4>
<br>
<p>It is recommended that the <u><a style="color:white" href="https://mayor.dc.gov/">Mayor of the District of Columbia</a></u> update the Data Policy to change the annual due date for the EDI and CDO report from November 1 to the Monday of <b><a style="color:white" href="http://sunshineweek.org/">Sunshine Week</a>.</b> “Sunshine Week is a national initiative spearheaded by the American Society of News Editors to educate the public about the importance of open government and the dangers of excessive and unnecessary secrecy. It was established in March 2005 with funding from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. Sunshine Week occurs each year in mid-March, coinciding with James Madison's birthday and National Freedom of Information Day on the 16th.” It is simply fortuitous that the initial EDI and report are being published March 11, 2018, the start of Sunshine Week 2018. Nevertheless, the goals of Sunshine Week and of the Data Policy closely align, and Sunshine Week activities offer significant opportunities to call attention to the District’s progress on open governance.
<br>
<br>
In addition to this, the current report date of November 1 means that the EDI will coincide with many District reports that are due at the end of the fiscal year. There are also many personnel, procurement, and financial actions due during the same time. Moving the EDI deadline to mid-March will mean that the EDI will not conflict with the other priorities facing District managers.
<br>
<br>
Finally, having just completed the initial inventory, it is too soon for agencies to revisit their work for November 1, 2018. The data inventory can be beneficial to agencies, but only if it is not too burdensome.</p>
