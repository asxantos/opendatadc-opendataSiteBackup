<h4>Encourage Independent Agency Participation in the Enterprise Dataset Inventory</h4>
<br>
<p>The current Data Policy is a Mayorâ€™s Order and therefore cannot be enforced for independent agencies. During this first EDI, 95.7% of mayoral agencies participated, including all large agencies, but only 24.2% of independent agencies participated. It is therefore recommended that OCTO do more to encourage participation. This should include seeking support from Deputy Mayors. If that fails, seeking legislation would be an option.
