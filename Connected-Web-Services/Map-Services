You don't need specialized GIS software to consume DC's map services. They are easily accessed within web browsers or custom applications. The data layers you see individually in <a href="http://opendata.dc.gov">Open Data DC</a>, are also published as a REST endpoint. We do our best to organize them into categories.
<br>
<br>
For example, the <a href="http://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/rest/services/DCGIS_DATA/Transportation_WebMercator/MapServer/5">Capital Bike Share</a> REST endpoint appears in the Transportation category. It is one among several! The Bike Availability map seen here is overlaying the layer onto <a href="http://www.arcgis.com">ArcGIS.com</a>.
