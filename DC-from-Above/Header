    <p>Since its inception in 2000, the District of Columbia GIS program has collected <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthophoto" target="_blank">Orthophotography </a>and now <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar" target="_blank">LiDAR </a>data on a regular basis. These aerial images have a
        variety of uses including web based visualizations and to create derivative data such as buildings, roads and
        elevation models. They are viewed in many District web applications and made available as downloadable files.
        They can also be accessed as web services to integrate into your own content.<br>

    <h3 class="text-left">Brush up on History</h3>
    <p>
        In the mid-1990's, before DC GIS, the <a href="https://www.ncpc.gov/" target="_blank">National Capital Planning Commission
        (NCPC)</a> and DC government departments teamed up to obtain aerial imagery for survey work. The resulting<a
            href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1Wt8FRXoFfJa0o4UXBRdlpKTVE/view" target="_blank">1995</a> and <a
            href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1Wt8FRXoFfJcWcwRTE5UUV5ejA/view" target="_blank">1999</a> images
        were
        used to support government operations in planning, property assessment and public works.<br>
        The 1995 and 1999 aerial projects compiled the imagery at 1 foot resolution. For its time this was considered
        great
        detail. However in comparison, the city's two most recent flights captured images at 3 inch resolution. This
        means
        that for every pixel, we are providing you 3 inches of ground cover.</p>
