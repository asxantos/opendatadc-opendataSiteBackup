        <p><a href="http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets?q=lidar" target="_blank">LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)</a>, is a remote
            sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure variable distances to the District's
            surface. The data collected is known as a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/public-datasets/dc-lidar/" target="_blank">point cloud
                dataset</a>
            which includes x, y, and z coordinates with additional details that can help classify landscape features.
            The z
            coordinates are what give us the three-dimensional space. These additional details can show us whether an
            area
            is comprised of vegetation, differences in hill shading or the city's <a

                solar potential</a>. This 3D array of data can be utilized for planning, measurements, and processed to
            create
            many derivative datasets.</p><br>
