<h3 class="text-left">Here to There in 2008 to 2015</h3> 

The planning, detail and coordination between us, the United States government and other key partners is a great deal. Timing is everything in these projects. When you look at the images below, you'll notice nuances like more leaf coverage in one versus the other. Perhaps you'll see more obscure areas as shadows. Take a look at the areas around the city where shadows in 2010 aren't present in 2015. This is all due to differences in time of year. We plan to fly in late winter when leaves haven't sprung yet and shadowing is minimal during the best time of day. However sometimes it just doesn't work out. Nonetheless, the data we derive from these images are valuable to us and you! Pan and zoom with the 2008 image so that other years will sync or switch syncing by clicking the circular arrows.
